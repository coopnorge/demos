<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for logon group checker</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
If a SAProuter was configured for a destination using load balancing, the message server connection
could not be established for checking whether the set of application servers belonging to a logon group had changed.
Then the log or trace file of JCo contained messages similar to
<pre>JCoException: (200) JCO_ERROR_MESSAGE_SERVER_FAILURE: Message Server query failed with return code -101. Check message host and port. Connect to message server failed
at com.sap.conn.jco.rt.DefaultMessageServer.checkRc(DefaultMessageServer.java:270)

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for thread-safe usage of t/q/bgRfc client calls</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
RFC client calls using the tRfc, qRfc or bgRfc protocol were not implemented thread-safe with regard to therein used TIDs,
queue names and unit IDs. When invoking remote function modules (RFMs) via the t/q/bgRfc protocol to the same
<code>JCoDestination</code> in multiple threads simultaneously, used TIDs, queue names and unit IDs could have been
overwritten and used in the wrong thread context, which might have led to lost data in the target system.<br>
For example, IDocs that seemed to have been transferred correctly without an error, were not stored in the target system,
because the TID contract was broken and several IDocs were erroneously sent at the same time with the same TID
although different ones had been specified.<br>
<em>Note:</em> This was a regression bug which was introduced with JCo 3.1.3.

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for compression handle leak</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
A compression handle leak existed in the implementation for processing incoming bgRFC units in a <code>JCoServer</code> instance.
After 1000 processed units no further data compressions were possible anymore leading to an <code>IOException</code>
being thrown with a detail message similar to "Error getting a compress handle: return code=-85".
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for memory leak in <code>JCoServer</code></b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
When a <code>JCoServer</code> application was running in an environment with network issues, JCo recognized the erroneous
situation incorrectly, so that the connection was not closed in the underlying CPIC layer leading to internal events
that were not properly handled and caused a memory leak. As a consequence, an <code>OutOfMemoryError</code>
occurred and in the JCo trace numerous entries similar to the following one were written within a few milliseconds always
indicating the same handle &lt;i&gt;:
<pre>
JCoDispatcherWorkerThread [&lt;time&gt;]: [JCoAPI] Dispatcher.getNextListener() = handle [&lt;i&gt;] for server ABC|0 [&lt;host&gt;|sapgw00|null|null|null|null|null|PROGID]
</pre>
Later in the trace, there can also be entries simliar to:<br>
<br>
<code>Error in SAP Listener: com.sap.conn.jco.JCoException: (121) JCO_ERROR_NULL_HANDLE: Invalid rfcHandle==null encountered in listen method</code>
</td></tr>.

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for <code>JCoServer</code> runtime of type WebSocket</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
After the invocation of a function module, the client side application was idle for a while, and thus the server. Therefore,
the WebSocket client triggered ping messages to keep the connection alive. Due to the recursion based internal design of the
<code>JCoServer</code>'s WebSocket ping handler, a large call stack could be built up. If it takes long enough, a
<code>StackoverFlowError</code> occurred at JCo side with repeated invocations of
<code>com.sap.conn.rfc.driver.WebSocketServerDriver.internalRead(WebSocketServerDriver.java:289)</code> and
<code>com.sap.conn.rfc.driver.WebSocketHelper.internalReadWS(WebSocketHelper.java:253)</code>.
</td></tr>.

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for stopping <code>JCoServer</code> of type WebSocket</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
When trying to stop a <code>JCoServer</code> of type WebSocket, the server never reached the state <code>JCoServerState.STOPPED</code>,
but remained in <code>JCoServerState.STOPPING</code>. This happened after the invocation of a function module and after the client side
application was idle for a while, and thus also the <code>JCoServer</code>. After processing a WebSocket ping, the server connection got
into a wrong state so that it could not be closed, but this would be required after requesting to stop the <code>JCoServer</code> instance
to which the server connection belongs.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for <code>JCoCustomRepository</code> runtime</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
When the new reentrance ticket technology introduced as of S/4HANA 1909 was used to logon to the communication partner system,
and the <code>JCoCustomRepository</code> was configured to use query mode <code>DISABLE_REPOSITORY_POOL</code>, querying RFC meta data
resulted in a logon failure complaining that the used logon ticket was invalid. Unfortunately, there was an implementation error in
conjunction with query mode <code>DISABLE_REPOSITORY_POOL</code> which resulted in the handed over reentrance ticket being used twice
so that the RFC logon failed the second time, because reentrance tickets are one-time tickets which can only be used once.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for <code>JCoRecord.fromJSON()</code></b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
If a JSON document contained numeric fields with negative values, e.g. for a field of type <code>BCD</code> or
<code>INT</code>, the JSON parser did not accept the sign character when analyzing the value for the given field.
In this case, <code>JCoRecord.fromJSON()</code> threw an exception similar to
<code>JCoSerializationException: (191) JCO_ERROR_SERIALIZATION: Digit(s) expected near position &lt;###&gt;</code>.

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Improvement for performance analysis</b></td></tr>

JCo now provides <code>JCoServer</code> processing time information for STAD and offers the ABAP server
processing time for JCo client scenarios via method <code>JCoThrougput.getServerTime()</code>.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Improvement for <code>JCoRepository</code></b></td></tr>

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for <code>JCoServer</code> start mechanism</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
A regression of JCo 3.1.2 compared to version 3.0 was fixed: When disabling a server by invoking
<code>JCoServer.stop()</code>, it was not possible to enable the server again using <code>JCoServer.start()</code>.
In this case the following <code>JCoRuntimeException</code> was thrown: "JCO_ERROR_CONFIGURATION: Unable to start the
server due to wrong configuration: no successful connection to any gateway could be established".
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for <code>JCoServerFactory.getNumberOfServerConnections()</code></b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
A regression of JCo 3.1.2 compared to version 3.0 was fixed: When trying to check the number of connections for a
registered server, an exception was thrown, if the passed server had not been started before. Now the number of existing
connections for the key triple of gateway host, gateway service, and program ID can always be fetched - independent
from the server state.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for callbacks to built-in functions</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
A regression of JCo 3.1.2 compared to version 3.0 was fixed: When calling a function module that is doing a callback to
the few built-in function modules in JCo, and the back-end is supporting basXML, the invocation failed with a
<code>JCO_ERROR_SYSTEM_FAILURE: Error while parsing bASXML document</code> caused by
<code>JCO_ERROR_XML_PARSER: Unexpected token in parameter %_RFC_DELTA1 of the current BXML document: 'R' at position ...</code>,
when receiving the results because the communication was wrongly adjusted to use basXML, even though the called function
module was not flagged to use basXML.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for initial values of STRING and XSTRING fields</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
Up to JCo 3.1.2, the initial value for fields of type STRING and XSTRING was <code>null</code>. Actually, when checking
the initial value in ABAP, this is different. Hence, JCo was corrected to behave the same and to use an emtpy String and
an empty byte array, respectively.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for logon parameter <code>jco.client.use_tls</code></b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
<code>jco.client.use_tls</code> is supposed to be an optional logon property defaulting to the secure setting <code>1</code>.
Previously, it had still to be specified to make a connection work, even if the default value was desired.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Bugfix for SSO logons via SNC</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
When using SNC together with the Single Sign On (SSO) mechanism for doing the RFC logon, i.e. property
<code>jco.client.snc_sso</code> was omitted or set to its default value <code>1</code>, and properties
<code>jco.client.user</code> and <code>jco.client.passwd</code> were specified in addition, then a basic authentication
RFC logon with user ID and password was performed instead of the configured SNC SSO. This might have resulted in
a different user than the desired one being logged on at the SAP system. Property <code>jco.client.passwd</code>
will be ignored now when SNC SSO is specified.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Enhancement for repository roundtrip optimization</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
In case the back-end is known to be new enough, and <code>jco.use_repository_roundtrip_optimization</code> has not been
set to 0, JCo will not check for the existence of <code>RFC_METADATA_GET</code> thus avoiding the need for providing
additional authorizations for the repository user.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Improvement at CPIC keep alive mechanism</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
The keep alive mechanism was re-implemented so that it better recognizes corrupt connections and black-hole routers,
but also allows to configure large timeouts which is needed for some scenarios.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Support for z/OS</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
With JCo 3.1.3 z/OS is supported again. See note SAP note

for the detailed list of supported versions.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Enhancement for MacOS</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
JCo will now work on MacOS without the need to modify the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file, even if network settings will not
allow to resolve the own hostname. See note SAP note
<a target="_blank" href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2942455">2942455</a> for details.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Enhancement for default values</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
Added support for the parameter default values <code>ABAP_TRUE</code>, <code>ABAP_FALSE</code>, and <code>ABAP_UNDEFINED</code>.
Furthermore, unknown variables and constants are now simply ignored instead of treating them as string literals.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Enhancement for reentrance ticket support</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
With S/4HANA 1909 the technology used for reentrance ticket support has changed. JCo 3.1.3 now supports this new approach.<br/>
<em>Note:</em> This variant of the reentrance ticket needs to be accompanied by the information about the user
(provided by the <code>DestinationDataProvider</code> implementation in property <code>jco.client.user</code>)
that it was created for.

JCo 3.1 is the successor of JCo 3.0. In note <a target="_blank" href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2786882">2786882</a>
you can find the JVMs and platforms on which the new version is supported. Please note that some platforms have been
dropped and that the minimum JVM version has been raised to Java 8. JCo 3.1 is supposed to be byte-code compatible to
JCo 3.0 as long as you are not using methods or fields, that have been deprecated in JCo 3.0. Those have been removed
from JCo 3.1. Below you can find a set of the most important new features now supported with JCo 3.1.

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Support for fast serialization</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
The RFC runtime of JCo can now serialize the function module data in the fast serialization mode, if the partner system
supports that serialization format as well. Technically, it is a column-based serialization of the data, which has been
shipped initially with application server ABAP 7.51 and has been downported later so that also older systems benefit
from the performance improvements of that serialization. Note <a target="_blank" href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2372888">2372888</a>

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Configuring a high availability registered server</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
The registration at a system instead of a single gateway allows to have high availability support for a
<code>JCoServer</code>. Thus, instead of registering only at one specific gateway, a server program can register at all
gateways belonging to a given system identified by the message server (with the possibility to limit the set of
application servers to a logon group). If one application server is shutdown or restarted (e.g. when doing a rolling
kernel update) the <code>JCoServer</code> can still be reached via the remaining gateways.<br/>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Change events for SessionReferenceProvider</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
Just like the DataProviders, also the <code>SessionReferenceProvider</code> allows to support events. Thus, connections
and sessions within the JCo runtime are cleaned up immediately whenever a session is terminated. Note that
<code>isSessionAlive()</code> will still be invoked from time to time in order to find zombie sessions that were
not cleaned up properly by session management.<br/>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Record conversion to and from JSON</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
All <code>JCoRecords</code> are offering the possibility to efficiently convert their data to a natural JSON representation
(<code>JCoTable</code> is represented as an array, <code>JCoStructures</code> as a JavaScript structure and each field
has the (uppercase) name like in ABAP). Furthermore, it is possible to fill <code>JCoRecords</code> from such documents
with data. Thus it is easily possible to offer simple and short JCo code that interacts with a JavaScript based user interface.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Multitenancy with JCo</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
By default, JCo 3.1 is still running in a single tenant mode. However, the JCo runtime has been extended to support
multi-tenant environments. By implementing and registering a <code>com.sap.conn.jco.ext.TenantProvider</code>, it is
possible to isolate <code>JCoDestinations</code> (and, certainly, the associated connections), <code>JCoRepositorys</code>,
and other important runtime artifacts for different tenants.

<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Support for new ABAP Types</b></td></tr>

The following new ABAP type is now supported by JCo: <code>UTCLONG</code>.<br/>
Find more details in the JavaDoc.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Support for configuring a load balancing destination with sticky behavior</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
Some JCo applications need to make sure that once a communication started with an application server, the same application
server is used for all requests afterwards, even if the executed requests are stateless. This allows efficient usage of
cached data and database buffers on application server side. Hence, JCo introduces the destination configuration parameter
<code>jco.client.sticky</code>, which specifies whether the pool should get sticky to the application server. After an
idle time period, during which the application does not execute any requests, a different application server could be used
for further requests, depending on the current load determined by the message server.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>MessageServer info</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
The package <code>com.sap.conn.jco.ms</code> allows to interact with a message server and to get information about the
application servers and groups in that system. The <code>JCoMessageServerFactory</code> fetches the necessary physical
information for the message server from the registered <code>com.sap.conn.jco.ext.MessageServerDataProvider</code> that
is fitting to the given logical message server.<br/>
Find more details in the JavaDoc.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>CPIC performance improvement in WAN scenarios</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
When executing requests in WAN scenarios and exchanging large data amounts, the streaming feature of CPIC allows to send
data without waiting for acknowledgements for each data package. Thus, latency effects and overall execution times are
dramatically decreased. JCo turns on CPIC streaming automatically, if the partner system supports it as well.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#CCCCFF" CLASS="TableHeadingColor"><td><b>Adjustable socket buffer size</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>
JCo allows to set the low-level socket buffer size via JCo property <code>jco.ni.socket_buffer_size</code>, which allows
to tune network performance.<br/>
Find more details about the parameter in the JavaDoc and in SAP notes
<a target="_blank" href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2047230">2047230</a> and

<tr><td>
With JCo 3.1, the default for JCo property <code>jco.use_repository_roundtrip_optimization</code> changed to 1, which
means that if the backend supports it, the network roundtrip optimized function module <code>RFC_METADATA_GET</code>
is used for better performance when looking up metadata.<br/>
As a consequence you might need to adopt the authorization profile for your repository user ID as described in SAP note
<a target="_blank" href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/460089">460089</a> if you were not using this
