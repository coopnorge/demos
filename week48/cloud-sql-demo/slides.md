# What is Cloud SQL?
## Let's talk about this cloud resource

- What is that about?
- How does it work?
- How many different ways of deployment you might have?

---

# What is that about?

Cloud SQL provides a cloud-based alternative 
to local and on-premise MySQL, PostgreSQL, 
and SQL Server databases. 

## What problem is Cloud SQL solving?

You **should use** Cloud SQL if you want to spend 
less time managing your database and more time using it.

## How is it solving this problem?

Cloud SQL manages your database instance. You manage your data.

# How does it work?

- Each Cloud SQL instance is powered by a virtual machine (VM)
  running on a host Google Cloud server.

- The database is stored on a scalable, durable network storage device called a
  persistent disk that attaches to the VM. 

- A static IP address sits in front of each VM to ensure that the IP address an
  application connects to persists throughout the lifetime of the Cloud SQL
  instance.

# How many ways do you potentially have to deploy Cloud SQL instance?

---

# The options

- You can deploy Cloud SQL instance with public or private IP
- You can require TLS enforcement
- You can use IAM based authentication

Let's bring some boring math (combinatorics) and say 
we want to calculate **a sequence without repetition**:

$$
A^k_n = \dfrac{n!}{(n-k)!}, A^1_2 = 2
$$

And then calculate the number of combinations:

$$
(A^k_n)^m, (A^1_2)^3 = 8
$$

# Are there any obscure issues?
## Let's talk about the challenges we had so far

---

# Generic questions

## Security

TLS, Google Cloud IAM, internal database roles.

### Example:

What is the difference between role `roles/cloudsql.instanceUser` and
role `roles/cloudsql.client`?

## Scalability

What type of the virtual machine I should choose for this
specific amount of data?

## Connection

How to connect to Cloud SQL from Google Managed resources,
API Platform or even from my MacBook?

# What is the expected developer experience with Cloud SQL?
## How can we approach the challenges with Cloud SQL?

---

# As a developer, I want a product...

- allows me to deploy Cloud SQL instance,
- the instance is available from the source I configure,
- I can configure identities with permissions,
- I can configure the hardware,
- also has a documented way to access this Cloud SQL instance from
  GKE, Google Cloud resource or my MacBook.
